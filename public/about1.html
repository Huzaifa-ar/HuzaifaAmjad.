<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Huzaifa, a passionate beginner web developer eager to bring creative and functional ideas to life on the web.
   With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’m dedicated to crafting clean, responsive websites that provide an enjoyable user experience on any device.
  </p>
<p>As I continue to grow my skills, I'm excited to explore modern frameworks and tools that make web development more efficient and dynamic.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on small personal projects like portfolio websites, blogs, and interactive forms to practice and refine my skills. 
  I’m constantly learning, whether through online courses, coding challenges, or exploring open-source projects on GitHub.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to taking on new challenges, collaborating with others, and contributing to real-world projects that push me further in my development journey. 
  Let's build something great together!</p>
